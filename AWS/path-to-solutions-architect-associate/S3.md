#### What is S3?
* **Object Storage**: S3 provides secure, durable, highly scalable object storage.
* **Scalable**: S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web at a very low cost.
* **Simple**: Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web service interface.
* S3 IS OBJECT-BASED-STORAGE: Manages data as objects rather than in file systems or data blocks.
  * **Upload any file type** you can think of to **S3**
  * **Examples** include photos, videos, code, documents, and text files.
  * **Cannot** be used to run an operating system or database.

#### S3 Basics
* **Unlimited Storage**: The total volume of data and the number of objects you can store is unlimited.
* **Objects up to 5TB in Size**: S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to maximum of 5 terabytes.
* **S3 Buckets**: Store files in buckets (similar to folders).

#### Working with S3 Buckets
* **Universal Namespace**: All AWS accounts share the S3 namespace. Each S3 bucket name is globally unique.
* **Example S3 URLs**:
  * https://bucket-nname.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name
  * https://acloudguru.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/orhasson.jpg
* **Uploading Files**: When you upload a file to an S3 bucket, you will receive an HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful.
* **Key-Value Store**:
  * Key: The name of the object (e.g., Hasson.jpg)
  * Value: The data itself, which is made up of a sequence of bytes
  * Version ID
